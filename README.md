# tic-tac-toe
Jeffrey Eymer, 2016

This is a simple Java program of the game Tic Tac Toe made using Java Swing. It can currently be played only with two people, but in the future I plan to add support in for playing alone.

This was a simple Swing project aimed towards bettering my understanding of using Swing. It was also meant to be used in an attempt to learn git and understand how to update and publish code to my Github.

I originally had the code all in one file (MainWindow.java). I have since then split the code up into seperate classes for organization and neatness purposes.

Future plans for the program are to add one-player (vs. CPU) support as well as potentially some customization options.
